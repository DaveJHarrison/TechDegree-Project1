        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am married with 2 grown up children who are both pursuing their own careers in the digital world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My career to date has been spent working in electrical engineering, telecom engineering and latterly product development/management. I have now reached the point where I would like to work for myself doing something that I think I will enjoy immensely. Hence my decision to re-train as a front-end developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a highly motivated and results-orientated individual who has the ability to lead matrix teams to deliver complex projects. I possess a strong business and commercial focus gained in various product and project management roles. Excellent track record in developing and launching projects/products in tight timescales. When I have finished this course, I hope I will be able to say that I am well on the way to being a competent front-end developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have quite a few Hobbies and Interests, some of which I have listed below:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Football - </strong>Football is my favourite sport although my mind still wants to play, my legs are less willing! However, I do love watching football and am a season ticket holder and massive fan of <a href="https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/" target="blank">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> who were promoted to the English Premier League at the end of the 2016/17 season. In reality, I enjoy watching most sports especially 'live' events.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Skiing - </strong>My favourite ski resorts are Vail, Breckenridge and Beaver Creek all of which I have been lucky enough to visit on 3 different holidays. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vailmtn/photos/a.183988516305.127802.8310961305/10154951460461306/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">Blue Sky Basin,</a> one of the back bowls at Vail, is my favourite area.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reading - </strong>I love reading especially adventure and crime novels. One of my favourite authors is Wilbur Smith. I have read all of his books, some of them more than once!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Listening to Music - </strong>I enjoy listening to music both at home and when on the go. My favourite band is Coldplay who I have seen live in concert three times.
              </li>
              <li>
                .....there are others as such as walking, swimming, going on holiday, going to Bars/Restaurants with friends.
              </li>
